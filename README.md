This site was made primarily with the use of express JS as a way of creating a web server with a mix of HTML, jQuery, and the help of bootstrap to make everything look pretty.

The purpose of the site is to create an app that allows to you fill out a quick survey and find friends with similar temperments. 

This is done by posting the survey information to the server in JSON format then running a quick algorithm to determine which individual out of the list of JSON objects is the closest match to your answers.
The app then has a pop up modal that displays the name and photo of your new friend.

By clicking the api Friends list at the bottom of the screen you can see into the inner workings of the page and check out the list of individuals that have completed the survey.

Also there is a button for the GIT Repo at the bottom of the page that will send you to the git repository so you can inspect the code.

Hope you enjoy my website!
